# Automated-Evaluation-of-Handwritten-Answer-Scripts-final-year-project-
The development and implementation of an automated evaluation system for handwritten answer scripts marks a significant
advancement in education assessment. By utilising machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, this project
effectively addresses the challenges of manual evaluation including time constraints and subjective biases.
Developed an automated system using cosine similarity, Jaccard index, Levenshtein distance and OCR to evaluate
handwritten answer scripts.
Addressed inefficiencies of manual grading by providing timely feedback to students.
Aimed to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and fairness in grading process.
